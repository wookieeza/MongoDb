/* LEVEL 4 - Data Modelling : referencing // embedding documents*/

Mongo has no concept of transactions by default

Embedding: Single query for all data, atomic writes. Child accessed through parent

Referencing: Requires 2 or more queries to get / update etc, referenced exist independently in collection or different collection

Q1: used together?  strongly related?
if data more often / sometimes used together - embed

usually embed

Q2: size
if less than 100 comments wih a user per potion, embed, if more than 100, consider embedding

Q3: Data change often?
rarely: embed
Occasionally embed / reference
constantly: reference

potion:comment:user?

reference user user may occasionally change dont want duped everywhere, but embed comments on potion - strongly related

{
  "name":"Invisibility",
  "comments":[
    {
     "title":"Best eva",
     "body":"Amaze",
     "user_id":"Sauron"
    }
  ]

}

Rules of thumb:

- Generally embedding is the best starting point
- Reference Data when you nee dto access the document independently
- Consider referencing when you have large doc sizes
- Decide by looking at how your data is going to be used, only needed user name on potions page per comment
- if you rata is very relational, maybe nee dto use relational db rather than document oriented db
